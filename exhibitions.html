  <img src="sn.jpg" alt="" height="30%" width="30%" class="sn">
  <h6>Van Gogh's Starry Night is one of the most most famous paintings in post-impressionist culture. It is currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Unlike most of Dutch artist's paintings, Starry Night was painted from memory. At that time, Van Gogh was in the hospital of Saint-Remy, tormented by fits of madness.</h6>

  <h5>Girl with a Pearl Earring (c. 1665) by Johannes Vermeer</h5>
  <img src="p.jpg" alt="" class="p">
 <h6> It features a young lovely woman wearing an exotic gown, an oriental headdress, and an unusually huge pearl in her ear. Even if a female sat and posed for this artwork, it lacks distinguishing traits – there are no warts, scarring, or blemishes to be observed. The young woman, set against a dark backdrop, wears a bright yellow and blue turban and a gleaming pearl. Her dazzling complexion reflects Vermeer’s command of light and tone, and small glints of white on her opened red lips make them look wet.</h6>
