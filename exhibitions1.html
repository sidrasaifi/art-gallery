  <img src="sn.jpg" alt="" height="30%" width="30%" class="sn" align="center">
  <h6>Van Gogh's Starry Night is one of the most most famous paintings in post-impressionist culture. It is currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Unlike most of Dutch artist's paintings, Starry Night was painted from memory. At that time, Van Gogh was in the hospital of Saint-Remy, tormented by fits of madness.</h6>

  <h5>Girl with a Pearl Earring (c. 1665) by Johannes Vermeer</h5>
  <img src="p.jpg" alt="" class="p">
 <h6> It features a young lovely woman wearing an exotic gown, an oriental headdress, and an unusually huge pearl in her ear. Even if a female sat and posed for this artwork, it lacks distinguishing traits – there are no warts, scarring, or blemishes to be observed. The young woman, set against a dark backdrop, wears a bright yellow and blue turban and a gleaming pearl. Her dazzling complexion reflects Vermeer’s command of light and tone, and small glints of white on her opened red lips make them look wet.</h6>

  <h5>Summer Evening at Skagen by Peder Severin Kroyer</h5>
  <img src="ss.jpg" alt height="30%" width="30%">
  <h6>Peder Severin Kryer's painting Summer Evening on Skagen's Southern Beach is considered one of his finest. Kryer was one of the most well-known members of the Skagen Painters, a group of Danish artists. Kryer's works frequently emphasize the Skagen light's distinctive effects, including numerous notable works representing beach scenes. The artwork was inspired by Anna Ancher and Marie Kryer's walk along the beach following a dinner party at the Kryers' home in the summer of 1892, when the guests went down to the shore to enjoy the wonderful evening.</h6>

  <h5>The Beach at Trouville by Claude Oscar Monet</h5>
  <img src="bb.jpg" alt="" height="30%" width="30%" >
  <h6>Monet blends conscious and unconscious via dissolving shapes, effacing identities, and dissolving forms. This work has sand on its surface, which was blown on to the wet canvas as Monet worked in the open air on the beach at Trouville in Normandy. The woman on the left is thought to represent Camille, Monet's first wife.</h6>
